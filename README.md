Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text Web Application

## üìö Overview
This is a web-based application that utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to convert text to speech and vice versa. The application allows users to input text which gets converted to speech (Text-to-Speech) and also allows users to speak, which will be transcribed into text (Speech-to-Text). The project showcases the practical use of NLP models and APIs for both tasks.

This project is developed as part of a college project and is designed to help users with accessibility needs or for anyone who wants to interact with content more interactively.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts user-inputted text into natural-sounding speech.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Transcribes spoken words into text.
- **Real-time interaction**: Supports real-time text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion.
- **Multi-language support**: Supports multiple languages for both TTS and STT functionality (depending on available API).
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Designed for efficient use with minimal latency.

## üîß Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js)
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express)
- **NLP Models**: 
    - Google Text-to-Speech API
    - Google Speech-to-Text API
- **Libraries**:
